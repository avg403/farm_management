    Organic farming is a sustainable and environmentally-friendly agricultural approach that prioritizes the use of natural and chemical-free methods to grow crops and raise livestock. One of the fundamental principles of organic farming is soil health. Organic farmers focus on building and maintaining healthy soil through practices like crop rotation, composting, and the use of organic matter. Healthy soil is the foundation for nutrient-rich and resilient crops.

    In organic farming, the use of synthetic pesticides and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is prohibited. Instead, farmers employ natural alternatives, such as beneficial insects, to control pests and diseases. This minimizes the negative impact on ecosystems and reduces the risk of harmful chemical residues in the food supply. Additionally, organic farming often promotes biodiversity by providing habitat for a wide range of wildlife, further enhancing the overall sustainability of the farm.
